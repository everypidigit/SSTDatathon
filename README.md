# sst_fire
A repository that contains all of the files for the SST case from the Google Datathon


The sst256.ipynb notebook contains the code for the neural network itself. It is based on the Cifar10CNN architecture, a really simple one.
The sorter.ipynb notebook contains the code to sort the training images folder. Since they were not sorted beforehand, I wanted to sort them in separate folders:
0 for 'no fire' and 1 for 'with fire'.

Some of the files and folders, namely labels.csv and the training and test ones, were renamed because it was easier for me to use them in that way. No files
were added or deleted. 

All of the images were resized to 256x256 pixels size.
